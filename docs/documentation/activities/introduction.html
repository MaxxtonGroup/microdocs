        MicroDocs is a tool for service documentation. The idea is to create documentation that scales with your
        Microservices. Which means to centralize and organise documentation of several project and show their relations,
        like you need when youâ€™re doing Microservices.
      </p>
      <p>
        icroDocs uses under the hood the Open Api standard (with some additions) to ensure compatibility with other api
        tools. We are also working on supporting Api blueprint and RAML.
      </p>
      <p>
        The flow of how you can use MicroDocs consist of 3 steps:
      <ol>
        <li>Extract MicroDocs definitions from the source code on build time</li>
        <li>Publish the definitions to the MicroDocs server</li>
        <li>Discover the RestAPI documentation through the web interface or use API to integrate with hundreds of other
          api tools
        </li>
      </ol>
      </p>
